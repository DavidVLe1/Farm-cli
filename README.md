# Farm-CLI

My CLI app is a farm simulator app where the user can run their own farm and raise animals and crops as well as selling them to make profit. Users just need to call Ruby app.rb
to run the app and enter a number matching any of the options provided when the app is launched.

- Ruby version: `3.2.1`
